The following directions, with additional details, are repeated inside the question's starter code.


**1) Question01: Classes and Arrays**

   - Initialize the position to be the center of the screen. 
   - Move the smiley in both x and y, at a random speed between -3 and 3 in each direction.

  - Start with just one smiley.  
  - Each time a smiley reaches an edge of the screen, add a new smiley.  
  - When the max number of smileys is reached, reset the program to have just one smiley.
